ASP.NET Core Library Guide
==========================

The `Stormpath.AspNetCore`_ package is a plugin for ASP.NET Core that makes it *incredibly*
simple to add users and authentication to your application.  It aims to completely
abstract away all user registration, login, authentication, and authorization
concerns, and make building secure websites painless.  And the best part?  **You
don't even need a database!**

This documentation will show you how to get started with Stormpath and ASP.NET Core.  If
you're a new user, start here!
